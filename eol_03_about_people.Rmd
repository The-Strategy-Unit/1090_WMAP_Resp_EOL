# About people

## Population analysis of deceased adults

Deceased adults in your STP are the population under consideration throughout
this report. Here we look at the characteristics of this population, from
demographic information about a person to the numbers estimated to be
experiencing unrelieved pain at the end of life in our think-piece based on
research by the Office of Health Economics and applied to your STP.

Much of the demographic information is likely to be intuitively understood
already, for example deaths increasing with age. However, an exploration of end
of life care should be considered from a population’s perspective, meaning a
review of their characteristics forms an important component of this report.

### The age at which people die

Age is obviously one of the key factors in how likely a person is to die.
Therefore, as would be expected, the largest number of deaths occur in those
patients who are older. The largest single group within the population are those
aged 85 and over.

Broken down further by gender there are more females than males in the older
ages categories, particularly in the very old (those aged 90 and older), linking
back to the longer life expectancy we see for females. 

#### percentage of decedents in each age group

Midlands as a whole*

### The level of deprivation experienced by people who die

Here we use the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD)[^1] which ranks every small
area or neighbourhood in England from most deprived to least deprived. The list
of ranked areas in England is then split into quintiles (each containing 20 per
cent of areas). The most deprived areas are in the first quintile and the least
deprived areas in the fifth quintile.

Each person is linked to one of the five England deprivation quintiles based on
where they live. For your STP we show the numbers from your population by
quintile and how this compares to the Midlands as a whole.

#### percentage of decedents in each quintile of deprivation

*Bars represent the percentage for your STP, dots the percentage for the
Midlands as a whole*


```{r deprivation quintile bar plot, fig.height = 3.5}
inner_join(
  count(mpi, imd_quintile, name = "stp"),
  count(mpi_region, imd_quintile, name = "region"),
  by = "imd_quintile"
) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(stp_n = glue("n = {comma(stp)}")) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(stp, region), ~.x / sum(.x)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(imd_quintile, stp)) +
  geom_col(fill = su_theme_cols("orange"),
           colour = su_theme_cols("charcoal"),
           alpha = 0.4,
           width = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(y = 0.0025, label = stp_n),
            size = 3,
            vjust = "bottom") +
  geom_point(aes(y = region),
             size = 2,
             shape = "circle filled",
             stroke = 1.5,
             colour = su_theme_cols("charcoal")[[1]],
             fill = su_theme_cols("red")[[1]]) +
  scale_imd(quintiles = TRUE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent,
                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "Percentage of Decedents by Age Band")
```

### The ethnicity of people who die

The ethnicity population breakdown is shown for your STP and also a comparator
chart showing how this compares to the Midlands as a whole. 

If the comparator bar is negative i.e. below the axis, then that ethnic
population is a lower proportion for your STP than it is for the Midlands. If
the comparator bar is positive i.e. above the axis, then that ethnic population
is a higher proportion for your STP than it is for the Midlands.

#### difference in percentage of population for your STP from the Midlands percentage

```{r ethnicity percentage diff bar plot, fig.height = 3.5}
local({
  ethnic_count <- function(data) {
    data %>%
      count(ethnic_group) %>%
      mutate_at(vars(n), ~.x/sum(.x))  
  }
  
  full_join(
    ethnic_count(mpi) %>%
      rename(stp = n),
    ethnic_count(mpi_region) %>%
      rename(region = n),
    by = "ethnic_group"
  ) %>%
    mutate(diff = stp - region) %>%
    ggplot(aes(ethnic_group, diff)) +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
    geom_col(colour = su_theme_cols("charcoal"),
             fill = su_theme_cols("orange"),
             alpha = 0.4,
             width = 0.5) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 15, hjust = 1)) +
    labs(x = "", y = "% difference from region average")
})
```

## Think-piece: The experience of pain at end of life

The Office of Health Economics (OHE) published in 2019 a report investigating
levels of unrelieved pain in palliative care in England[^2]. This report
estimated that 378,427 people receive palliative care each year and 125,971 of
those patients receiving, or in need of, palliative care suffered from some
level of unrelieved pain. 16,130 of these patients experienced no relief from
pain at all. 

Estimates of the palliative population who suffer from unrelieved pain were
calculated using an extrapolation method. The steps in this method were: from
all deaths estimate the sub-population of palliative patients[^3]; estimate the
rates of unrelieved pain by death setting; apply these rates to the palliative
care population.

There are many sources estimating rates of unrelieved pain in palliative care
and these are discussed in further detail in the OHE report. The estimates
actually used are from National Survey of Bereaved People (VOICES) survey[^4]
which collected information on bereaved people’s view of the level of pain
experienced (e.g. no pain relief at all, partial pain relief etc.) by their
friend or relative on a setting by setting basis.

From these estimates rates of unrelieved pain for are highest for those patients
who die at home. They are lowest for those who die in a hospice setting. This
presents an opportunity for STP's to explore what can be done to support people
dying in their own home and reducing the likelihood of them experiencing pain at
the end of their life.
